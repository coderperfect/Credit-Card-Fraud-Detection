# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit Card Frauds can be very subtle and at the same time large scale hazard. We compared two Anomaly detection algorithms:
1. Isolation Forest
2. Local Outlier Factor

Based on complexity of data either one can give the better result. In our dataset Isolation Forest has the upper hand.
